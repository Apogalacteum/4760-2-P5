 - general logic for this project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Notes:
Log file for version control is in gitlog.txt
Log file for processes is in log.txt

!! -- INCOMPLETE -- !!
The project currently does not run to specifications.
STUCK IN LOOP. NOT SURE WHERE.

I'm nearing the finish line for this project but I just couldn't finish it in time.
I just have to finish up the scheduling algorithm and implement my user processes
and it should be fine.
