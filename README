The program does not compile.

I'm sorry this is late. I didn't want to turn it in if it couldn't even compile
but I'm just starting to get frustrated by the amount of bugs I have in this code.
I think I will need to start from scratch in the next project, rather than
attempt to modify the previous project. I just get way too lost in my unorganized code.
